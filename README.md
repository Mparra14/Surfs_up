# Surfs_up
## Overview 
In this project, we were tasked by an investor in Oahu, that would like more information on the weather for his investment decision. The investment is a surf shop that will also serve ice cream, but he is afraid that weather will affect the sales. He asked for a weather analysis for the months of June and December before he invests in the shop. We were given a Sqlite file to query over using SQLAlchemy and using Pandas methods to create a dataframe and get statistical analysis for each month. 

## Results
Looking at the statistical data from both months the following can be seen:
For the month of June:
 * We see that the average temperature is 74.94 F°.
 * The highest tempereture during this month is 85 F°.
 * The lowest temperature for this is month was 64 F°. These can be seen in the table below.

 For the month of Decemeber:
 * It's seen that the average temperature is 71 F°.
 * The highest temperature for this month is 83 F°.
 * The lowest temperature for this month is 56 F°. These results can be seen below.

##Summary 
 With the statistics for each month, it can be seen that for both of the months's temperatures it only differs slightly, as the average temperature for Decemeber drops about 3 degrees when compared to the average temperature in June. It seems that the island has a relatively standard temparature year round, considering we only looked at two months out of the whole year, but these results are based from seven years of data of the island. Therefore if customers are willing to buy ice cream or surf  in June, there shouldn't be a reason why they wouldn't on an avarage day in Decemeber. Even though temperature should be considered when looking at weather, there is another factor that also weighs in it, and that is rain. Even if the temperature is adequate for surfing or ice cream, that does not mean that rain will not affect sales. If it does rain, there will not be much surfing or people going out to buy ice cream, so we should look at the precipitation statistics for both months.
